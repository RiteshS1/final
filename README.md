Learning : How to create a new branch and then merge it with the main branch after the req modifications!
Practice : Use of CLI.
Command used to check all the branches on bash : git branch
Command used to switch from one branch to another say from main to alien : git checkout alien
then to create new files we use the "touch" command.
